# evolution-of-species

This is a simple evolution simulator I made as a part of an honors project in the Fall 2023 semester. It is still a work in progress, as there are a few methods of the main file I have not yet completed. I intend to finish it one day.

This project was made following along with Rouben Rostamian's book "Programming in C for Students of Engineering, Science, and Mathematics." It makes use of the code in https://github.com/MathAkemi/c-tools.
